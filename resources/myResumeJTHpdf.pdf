SUMMARY
Strive for perfection, excellence accepted! Has been one of my favorite business mantra's for years now. I've learned and respect the importance of production from past experiences. I can balance that well with the ability to learn new skills and stay sharp with current ones. When all other fields are equal, I feel I am set apart and excel above all others due to 4 years active duty in the Marine Corps as an infantryman, 2x Iraq combat veteran.
